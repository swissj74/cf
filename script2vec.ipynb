    "## Why?\n",
    "The path a story takes in going from an idea to being an entertainment product that delights thousands, is not usually a straight path and often very iterative. Rights are bought, scripts written, and decisions made that flush out the story and turn it into the polished product we see on the silver screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition is fierce in the entertainment world and with today's short attention spans, capturing your audience is a must. And no amount of glimmer and noise will mask a bad story. Content is king even at the movies. It is easy to show that there is a relationship between dollars spend and dollars made. The more a movie is advertised, the more likely it will make money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, out of 10 movies produced 1 will be a block-buster, 2 will fail, and the remainder more or less break even. And the one blockbuster makes up for both failures plus some. Our goal isn't to make every movie a hit, rather our goal is to move that needle a little bit because even a little bit better means millions more in revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What\n",
    "In this algorithm, I am taking a look at scripts. Using deep learning I want to see if patterns can be discoverd in the language of the script that can help me move the needle\n",
    "\n",
    "## How\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using TensorFlow's word2vec to embed the words of each script in a vectorspace. In another module, I will be using deep learning algorithms and other machine learning algorithms to discover patterns in those embeddings. This will be based on https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.11/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What now (To Do)\n",
    "Use IMDB and other such data to draw a general picture of what features of a produced movie (minus the script) are important in determining success"
